 Here, I have tried to use the LSTM model to predict the ratings based on the reviews posted on the trip advisor website. LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory model. It is a type/variant of vanilla RNN (Recurring Neural Networks). Since RNN's have got some significant limitations such as that of Vanishing Gradient Descent problem and poor performance in cases involving 'Long Term Dependencies', LSTM's offer an alternative by overcoming these limitations. That's why, LSTM's are found to be more convenient and reliable (as in here the reviews in the dataset involve long term dependency but LSTM handles it well). I have also carried the hyperparameter tuning to enhance the accuracy results.
